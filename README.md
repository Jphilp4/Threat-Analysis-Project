# 🔐 Web Application Threat Modelling: STRIDE Methodology

---

## Project Overview  
In this project, I used the **STRIDE Methodology** to conduct a comprehensive threat modelling exercise for a web application. By leveraging **Draw.io**, I was able to visually represent and categorise potential security threats within the web application's architecture.

---

## Project Highlights  
### What I Did:
- 🏗 **Created a Threat Model**: Used **Draw.io** to create a detailed diagram representing the system components of the web application.  
- 🔍 **Applied STRIDE Methodology**: Identified and classified potential threats across six categories: **Spoofing**, **Tampering**, **Repudiation**, **Information Disclosure**, **Denial of Service**, and **Elevation of Privilege**.  
- ⚖️ **Mitigated Security Risks**: Developed strategies to mitigate the identified threats at each component of the architecture.  
- 🔐 **Improved Web Application Security**: Gained a deeper understanding of web application security risks and how to prevent them.

---

### Next Phase:  
- 🔒 **Security Enhancements**: Implement security best practices based on the threat model, including stronger authentication mechanisms and encryption techniques.  
- 📊 **Ongoing Risk Assessment**: Continuously evaluate and update the threat model as the web application evolves.  
- 🛡 **Penetration Testing**: Perform penetration testing on identified threats to validate the mitigation strategies.

## Why STRIDE?  
The **STRIDE Methodology** is an effective approach to identifying potential security threats in systems. By breaking down threats into specific categories, it provides a structured way to anticipate risks and implement preventative measures, ensuring a secure web application architecture.
